# Dynamic biplot visualisations with  `moveEZ`

The moveEZ R package provides visualisation tools to dynamically display sequential changes in multivariate data by animating biplots according to a changing factor which is typically time, but could be any controlled factor. This package extends the methodology of the biplotEZ package and in the current version utilises principal component analysis (PCA) biplots. This presentation will showcase the functionalities of the moveEZ package by focusing on a multivariate climate related data set obtained from the fifth generation ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate, known as ERA5. It will be shown how the associations of climate conditions can be exposed by means of suitable biplot visualisations, with observations in the biplot representing monthly measurements per climate region and vectors reflect the measured climate conditions. The dynamic visualisations offer a compelling visualisation of shifting climate patterns and provide insight into subtle changes. To conclude, an additional example will be presented to show how the moveEZ package can be extended beyond a time variable to enable the visualisation of controlled factors in experimental designs, specifically to understand the relationships between emission factors in a wood-burning stove.
